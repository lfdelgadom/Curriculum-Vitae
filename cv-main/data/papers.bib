abstract = {{Motivation: Recombination is a fundamental process in molecular evolution, and the identification of recombinant sequences is thus of major interest. However, current methods for detecting recombinants are primarily designed for aligned sequences. Thus they struggle with analyses of highly diverse genes, such as the var genes of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, which are known to diversify primarily through recombination. Results: We introduce an algorithm to detect recent recombinant sequences from a dataset without a full multiple alignment. Our algorithm can handle thousands of gene-length sequences without the need for a reference panel. We demonstrate the accuracy of our algorithm through extensive numerical simulations; in particular, it maintains its effectiveness in the presence of insertions and deletions. We apply our algorithm to a dataset of 17,335 DBLα types in var genes from Ghana, observing that sequences belonging to the same ups group or domain subclass recombine amongst themselves more frequently, and that non- recombinant DBLα types are more conserved than recombinant ones.

abstract = {{Immunity to Plasmodium falciparum is non-sterilizing, thus individuals residing in malaria-endemic areas are at risk of infection throughout their lifetime. Here we seek to find a genomic epidemiology explanation for why residents of all ages harbor blood stage infections despite lifelong exposure to P. falciparum in areas of high transmission. We do this by exploring for the first time the age-specific patterns of diversity of variant antigen encoding (var) genes in the reservoir of infection. Microscopic and submicroscopic P. falciparum infections were analyzed at the end of the wet and dry season in 2012-2013 for a cohort of 1541 residents from 1 to 91 years in an area characterized by high-seasonal malaria transmission in Ghana. By sequencing the near ubiquitous DBLα that encodes immunogenic domains, we defined var gene diversity in an estimated 1,096 genomes detected in sequential wet and dry season sampling of this cohort. Unprecedented var (DBLα) diversity was observed in all ages with 42,399 unique var types detected. There was a high degree of maintenance of types between seasons (>40\% seen more than once), with many of the same types, especially upsA, appearing multiple times in isolates from different individuals. Children and adolescents were found to be significant reservoirs of var DBLα diversity compared to adults and younger children. Var repertoires within individuals were highly variable, with children having more related var repertoires compared to adolescents and adults. Individuals of all ages harbored multiple genomes with var repertoires unrelated to those infecting other hosts. High turnover of parasites with diverse isolate var repertoires was also observed in all ages. These age-specific patterns are best explained by variant-specific immune selection. The observed level of var diversity for the population was then used to simulate the development of variant-specific immunity to the diverse var types under conservative assumptions. Simulations showed that the extent of observed var diversity with limited repertoire relatedness was sufficient to explain why adolescents and adults in this community remain susceptible to blood stage infection, even with multiple genomes.}},

Long-read sequencing using the PacBio Single Molecule Real Time (SMRT) sequencing platform has yielded promising results for CYP2D6 allele typing.

This study was conducted in an area of high seasonal malaria transmission in Bongo District, Ghana. IRS was implemented during the dry season (November-May) in three consecutive years between 2013 and 2015 to reduce transmission and attempt to bottleneck the parasite population in humans towards lower diversity with greater linkage disequilibrium. The study was done against a background of widespread use of long-lasting insecticidal nets, typical for contemporary malaria control in West Africa. Microsatellite genotyping with 10 loci was used to construct 392 P. falciparum multilocus infection haplotypes collected from two age-stratified cross-sectional surveys at the end of the wet seasons pre- and post-IRS. Three-rounds of IRS, under operational conditions, led to a >90\% reduction in transmission intensity and a 35.7\% reduction in the P. falciparum prevalence (p < .001). Despite these declines, population genetic analysis of the infection haplotypes revealed no dramatic changes with only a slight, but significant increase in genetic diversity (He : pre-IRS = 0.79 vs. post-IRS = 0.81, p = .048). Reduced relatedness of the parasite population (p < .001) was observed post-IRS, probably due to decreased opportunities for outcrossing. Spatiotemporal genetic differentiation between the pre- and post-IRS surveys (D = 0.0329 [95\% CI: 0.0209 - 0.0473], p = .034) was identified. These data provide a genetic explanation for the resilience of P. falciparum to short-term IRS programmes in high-transmission settings in sub-Saharan Africa.}},

abstract = {{Malaria remains a major public health problem in many countries. Unlike influenza and HIV, where diversity in immunodominant surface antigens is understood geographically to inform disease surveillance, relatively little is known about the global population structure of PfEMP1, the major variant surface antigen of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The complexity of the var multigene family that encodes PfEMP1 and that diversifies by recombination, has so far precluded its use in malaria surveillance. Recent studies have demonstrated that cost-effective deep sequencing of the region of var genes encoding the PfEMP1 DBLα domain and subsequent classification of within host sequences at 96\% identity to define unique DBLα types, can reveal structure and strain dynamics within countries. However, to date there has not been a comprehensive comparison of these DBLα types between countries. By leveraging a bioinformatic approach (jumping hidden Markov model) designed specifically for the analysis of recombination within var genes and applying it to a dataset of DBLα types from 10 countries, we are able to describe population structure of DBLα types at the global scale. The sensitivity of the approach allows for the comparison of the global dataset to ape samples of Plasmodium Laverania species. Our analyses show that the evolution of the parasite population emerging out of Africa underlies current patterns of DBLα type diversity. Most importantly, we can distinguish geographic population structure within Africa between Gabon and Ghana in West Africa and Uganda in East Africa. Our evolutionary findings have translational implications in the context of globalization. Firstly, DBLα type diversity can provide a simple diagnostic framework for geographic surveillance of the rapidly evolving transmission dynamics of P. falciparum. It can also inform efforts to understand the presence or absence of global, regional and local population immunity to major surface antigen variants. Additionally, we identify a number of highly conserved DBLα types that are present globally that may be of biological significance and warrant further characterization.}},

The role of this reservoir in the evolution and spread of drug resistance was explored. Methods Population genetic analyses of the key drug resistance-mediating polymorphisms were analysed in a cross-sectional survey of asymptomatic P. falciparum infections across all ages in Bongo District, Ghana. Results Seven years after the policy change to artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) in 2005, the Pfcrt K76 and Pfmdr1 N86 wild-type alleles, have nearly reached fixation and have expanded via soft selective sweeps on multiple genetic backgrounds. By constructing the Pfcrt-Pfmdr1-Pfdhfr-Pfdhps multilocus haplotypes we found that the alleles at these loci were in linkage equilibrium and that multidrug resistant parasites haven’t expanded in this reservoir. For Pfk13, 32 non-synonymous mutations were identified, however, none were associated with ACT resistance. Conclusions The prevalence and selection of alleles/haplotypes by antimalarials were similar to that observed among clinical cases in Ghana indicating they do not represent two sub-populations with respect to these markers. Thus, the P. falciparum reservoir in all ages can contribute to the maintenance and spread of antimalarial resistance.}},

abstract = {{In their competition for hosts, parasites with antigens that are novel to the host immune system will be at a competitive advantage. The resulting frequency-dependent selection can structure parasite populations into strains of limited genetic overlap. For the causative agent of malaria, Plasmodium falciparum, the high recombination rates and associated vast diversity of its highly antigenic and multicopy var genes preclude such clear clustering in endemic regions. This undermines the definition of strains as specific, temporally persisting gene variant combinations. We use temporal multilayer networks to analyze the genetic similarity of parasites in both simulated data and in an extensively and longitudinally sampled population in Ghana. When viewed over time, populations are structured into modules (i.e., groups) of parasite genomes whose var gene combinations are more similar within than between the modules and whose persistence is much longer than that of the individual genomes that compose them. Comparison to neutral models that retain parasite population dynamics but lack competition reveals that the selection imposed by host immunity promotes the persistence of these modules. The modular structure is, in turn, associated with a slower acquisition of immunity by individual hosts. Modules thus represent dynamically generated niches in host immune space, which can be interpreted as strains. Negative frequency-dependent selection therefore shapes the organization of the var diversity into parasite genomes, leaving a persistence signature over ecological time scales. Multilayer networks extend the scope of phylodynamics analyses by allowing quantification of temporal genetic structure in organisms that generate variation via recombination or other non-bifurcating processes. A strain structure similar to the one described here should apply to other pathogens with large antigenic spaces that evolve via recombination. For malaria, the temporal modular structure should enable the formulation of tractable epidemiological models that account for parasite antigenic diversity and its influence on intervention outcomes.}},

The combinatorial complexity of the var system remains beyond the reach of existing strain theory and previous evidence for non-random structure cannot demonstrate immune selection without comparison with neutral models. We develop two neutral models that encompass malaria epidemiology but exclude competitive interactions between parasites. These models, combined with networks of genetic similarity, reveal non-neutral strain structure in both simulated systems and an extensively sampled population in Ghana. The unique population structure we identify underlies the large transmission reservoir characteristic of highly endemic regions in Africa.

abstract = {{The concept of niche partitioning has received considerable theoretical attention at the interface of ecology and evolution of infectious diseases. Strain theory postulates that pathogen populations can be structured into distinct nonoverlapping strains by frequency‐dependent selection in response to intraspecific competition for host immune space. The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum presents an opportunity to investigate this phenomenon in nature, under conditions of high recombination rate and extensive antigenic diversity. The parasite's major blood‐stage antigen, PfEMP1, is encoded by the hyperdiverse var genes. With a dataset that includes thousands of var DBLα sequence types sampled from asymptomatic cases within an area of high endemicity in Ghana, we address how var diversity is distributed within isolates and compare this to the distribution of microsatellite allelic diversity within isolates to test whether antigenic and neutral regions of the genome are structured differently. With respect to var DBLα sequence types, we find that on average isolates exhibit significantly lower overlap than expected randomly, but that there also exists frequent pairs of isolates that are highly related. Furthermore, the linkage network of var DBLα sequence types reveals a pattern of nonrandom modularity unique to these antigenic genes, and we find that modules of highly linked DBLα types are not explainable by neutral forces related to var recombination constraints, microsatellite diversity, sampling location, host age, or multiplicity of infection. These findings of reduced overlap and modularity among the var antigenic genes are consistent with a role for immune selection as proposed by strain theory. Identifying the evolutionary and ecological dynamics that are responsible for the nonrandom structure in P. falciparum antigenic diversity is important for designing effective intervention in endemic areas. In this study, we test the hypothesis of niche partitioning to reduce trait overlap within a local community of Plasmodium falciparum strains. We examine patterns of diversity within the parasite's major blood‐stage antigen, which is likely the playing field for parasite competition over host immune space. We observe reduced overlap among isolates and modularity among antigenic types—indications that niche partitioning is promoting the coexistence of distinct strains within this highly endemic community despite recombination through high multiplicity of infection.}},

Analysis of the variation in 12 microsatellite loci was completed for 200 P. falciparum isolates collected from a cross-sectional survey of residents of all ages from two catchment areas in BD. Analysis of the multilocus haplotypes showed high levels of genetic diversity (He = 0.74), no population differentiation yet significant linkage disequilibrium (LD) (ISA = 0.0127, P = 0.006) in BD. Multilocus LD was significant between and within catchment areas even though every haplotype in the population was unique and the majority of individuals (84.0\%) harbored multiple-clone infections. The linkage structure among multilocus haplotypes was not associated with sampling location. These data provide the first study with deep sampling of the P. falciparum reservoir in an area of seasonal malaria transmission in West Africa. The co-occurrence of high multiplicity of infection (multiple-clone infections) with significant multilocus LD is surprising given the likelihood of high recombination rates in BD. The results suggest that the linkage structure among multilocus haplotypes has not been shaped by geographic separation of parasite populations. Furthermore, the observed LD levels provide a baseline population genetic metric with putatively neutral markers to evaluate the effects of seasonality and malaria control efforts in BD.}},

By sequencing the conserved DBLα domain of var genes from six sentinel sites in Uganda we found that the parasites causing uncomplicated P. falciparum disease in children were highly diverse and that every child had a unique var DBLα repertoire. Despite extensive var DBLα diversity and minimal overlap between repertoires, specific DBLα types and groups were conserved at the population level across Uganda. This pattern was the same regardless of the geographic distance or malaria transmission intensity.
