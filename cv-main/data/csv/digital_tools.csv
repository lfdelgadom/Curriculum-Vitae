\href{https://shaziaruybal.shinyapps.io/covidClassifyR}{CovidClassifyR \faExternalLink},Shazia Ruybal-Pesántez,Sep 2021,"This Shiny web application was developed to support COVID-19 serosurveillance in Papua New Guinea enabling classification of unknown samples as recently exposed to SARS-CoV-2. This tool makes the downstream processing, quality control and interpretation of the raw data generated from a validated COVID-19 serological assay \href{https://doi.org/10.3390/mps4040072}{(Mazhari et al 2020)} accessible to all researchers without the need for a specialist background in statistical methods and advanced programming. Funding was provided by a COVID-19 Digital Grant, \href{https://www.science.org.au/news-and-events/news-and-media-releases/regional-research-set-get-digital-boost}{media release \faExternalLink}"
\href{https://covid19analytics.shinyapps.io/VaccinationScore/}{COVID-19 VaccinationScore \faExternalLink},"Raúl Fernández, Shazia Ruybal-Pesántez, Esteban Ortíz",Feb 2021,"This Shiny web application was developed during the initial vaccine roll-out in Ecuador to help individuals better understand their ""priority status"" to receive their COVID-19 vaccine. An algorithm was applied to calculate a priority score based on an individuals answers to a set of questions on socioeconomic status, occupation, exposure, risk behavior, comorbidities, etc. \href{https://www.elcomercio.com/actualidad/herramienta-recibir-vacuna-covid19-ecuador.html}{Newspaper article (in Spanish) \faExternalLink}"
Serosurveillance of COVID-19 in Ecuadorian blood donors dashboard (not open-source),Shazia Ruybal-Pesántez,Jun 2020,"This R flexdashboard was developed to support COVID-19 serosurveillance in Ecuadorian blood donors in collaboration with the Ecuadorian Red Cross National Blood Bank as part of the emergency response to COVID-19 (active early in the pandemic, June 2020-Dec 2020). This dashboard presented anonymized and aggregated data generated from monthly screening of blood donation samples to visualize seroprevalence trends. Due to confidentiality and internal permissions at ERC this tool is not publicly available."
ICEMR weekly dashboard (not open-source),Shazia Ruybal-Pesántez,Mar 2020,"This R flexdashboard was developed to support the ICEMR field teams in Madang, Papua New Guinea (active during the entire longitudinal cohort study March 2020 until Sep 2021). This dashboard was updated weekly and presented operational data (e.g. follow-up rates in each field site) that could be used by the team to plan field activies and identify any areas for improvement as well as preliminary epidemiological trends (e.g. RDT positivity, prevalence of fever). As this tool was meant for internal use within the ICEMR project, it is not publicly available."
processqpcR ,Shazia Ruybal-Pesántez,In development,"This Shiny web application is in development to support laboratory researchers with little to no programming skills with a tool for downstream processing of raw data generated from several qPCR machines (e.g. Lightcyler480, Quantstudio, etc). Functions will include automatic matching of sample IDs using a user-supplied 96-well or 384-well plate map, quantification of unknown samples using the assay standard curve/positive controls (e.g. to detect malaria-positive samples) and some preliminary visualizations of the data."
